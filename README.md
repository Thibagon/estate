# Estate

This github repository is a playground/training area for the open source ERP Odoo
and should not be used as production module.

## Odoo's getting started

This repo represent the so called "Estate" module created by following the steps of [this](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/tutorials/getting_started.html) official tutorial.

This repo will not teach you how to make your own odoo module and serve as correction and review.

## One chapter one commit
Some chapters will be designated explicitly in the code due to the lack of repo in the hours of learning.
Nevertheless, the ideology of one chapter per commit should help to see relation between 
behaviour and added code
